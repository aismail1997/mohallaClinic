\section{Discussion}
\textcolor{red}{Depends on what the nature of your study was, but you might either leave the reader with design recommendations for the context you studied (e.g., how could HCI address the lives of young women in rural West Bengal facing constant threats to their safety) or else discuss the main takeaways for your desired readers of this paper (ICTD researchers? Other HCI researchers? Practitioners?). This needs thought and work. You need a week just to think about and iterate on the Discussion. Do not take this lightly. If you are taking on a particular theoretical lens, you will need to deeply engage with this lens through the Discussion.
