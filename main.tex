We present a perspective on the design of HCI4D interventions through the lens of design factors (encouraging vs mediate) use and non-use by target and non-target groups by presenting the case of Mohalla (or neighborhood) clinics introduced in Delhi. [Motivation?] We highlight the need to focus on designing for use and non-use as much as usability by presenting our findings from a multi-site ethnographic study on the use of the health care system [local state-supported]. Our study of the Mohalla clinics demonstrates the role [unpack what influences use/non-use] of socioeconomic, geographic and gender-related factors in the process of choosing to use a health care facility and we argue that we can design for use by the target group by taking these factors into consideration. Thus, we extend the definition of use to include processes that occur outside direct interaction with the technology. We invite the HCI4D community and policy makers to design their interventions for use by their target group towards greater impact.

%more here? 
The limited reach of the Mohalla clinics to its target group makes a case for viewing an intervention through the lens of designing for use and non-use by the target and non-target groups to ensure that it reaches those in 'need' of the intervention. While designing for use, the interplay of factors affecting use such as the design of the intervention, socioeconomic status, care by the actors and cultural norms should be taken into account. We offer this approach of 'designing for use and non-use' to the larger HCI4D community, as well as policy makers and organizations designing interventions.
