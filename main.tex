Example:
"We present the design, deployment, and mixed-methods evaluation of an interactive education software developed to circumvent taboos in teaching youth in India about HIV prevention. While extremely important, providing complete and accurate HIV education in India has historically been difficult because of cultural taboos around the virus' method of transmission. To address this gap, we used an iterative design process to develop a culturally appropriate educational software that leverages the unique affordances of technology and key theories from the learning sciences and communication. We demonstrate that this software leaves students significantly more knowledgeable about HIV transmission and prevention and with reduced stigma toward individuals infected with HIV. Validating its effectiveness in circumventing taboos, the software has since been adopted by numerous local governments in India where other HIV education materials had been banned, and students report extreme comfort learning from it. The methodology presented here has broader implications for the development and implementation of technology designed to educate on sensitive topics in health and other areas."

We present a novel perspective on the design of HCI4D interventions through the lens of design factors encouraging/discouraging use and non-use by presenting the case of neighborhood clinics introduced in Delhi. We highlight the need to focus on designing for use and non-use as much as usability by presenting our findings from a multi-site ethnographic study on use of the health care system. Our analysis of use and non-use by the target and non-target groups of Mohalla clinics demonstrates the role of socioeconomic, geographic and gender-related factors in the process of choosing to use a health care facility which determines the impact of the initiative in the long-run. Thus, we extend the definition of use to include processes that occur outside direct interaction with the technology. We invite the HCI4D community and policy makers to design their interventions for use by their target group towards greater impact.

* summarize findings 

* demonstrated X - how?

* offer a lens to view an intervention's success in the context of its use by target AND non-target populations. Discuss who this is meant to be applicable too - desired readers?
