\begin{abstract}
We present a qualitative study of Mohalla (neighborhood) Clinics - an intervention introduced by the state government of Delhi (India) in 2015 to provide access to basic health care. Though these clinics were introduced with the explicit objective of targeting the ``weakest sections of society,'' their actual use tells a different story. We conducted interviews and participant observations to study two Mohalla Clinics and their use by local residents who belonged to diverse socioeconomic groups. Our findings highlight the factors influencing the use of the clinics by targeted underserved sections of society when the same services are also desired (and availed) by non-targeted groups. We draw on these findings to inform the design of interventions, particularly in the context of use and non-use by identified target groups.

\section{Conclusion}
\textcolor{red}{[To be completed]}
%more here? 
The limited reach of the Mohalla clinics to its target group makes a case for viewing an intervention through the lens of designing for use and non-use by the target and non-target groups to ensure that it reaches those in 'need' of the intervention. While designing for use, the interplay of factors affecting use such as the design of the intervention, socioeconomic status, care by the actors and cultural norms should be taken into account. We offer this approach of 'designing for use and non-use' to the larger HCI4D community, as well as policy makers and organizations designing interventions.
