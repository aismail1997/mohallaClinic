\section{Findings}
\textcolor{red}{}
%In this section, we discuss our findings about the design and implementation of Mohalla clinics. In particular, we focus on factors that affect the use of these clinics by the target population and the non-use of these clinics by the non-target population. We consider, both, factors that encourage and discourage the desired behaviors. Thus, we classify our findings into four different categories. Factors that: (i) encourage use by target population, (ii) discourage use by target population, (iii) encourage non-use by non-target population, (iv) discourage non-use by non-target population.
%(RM: Assuming target population is folks from lower socio-economic background and non-target population is everyone else i.e. folks from higher socio-economic background.  Will have mentioned this in the intro.) 
Our analysis of the data collected revealed a story of use around Mohalla clinics and other government health care services. Other themes of gender, religion, education, socioeconomic and cultural factors emerged from our data around the larger theme of use and non-use. To discuss these themes in the context of use, we classify our findings into four different categories - factors that: (i) encourage use by target population, (ii) discourage use by target population, (iii) encourage non-use by non-target population, (iv) discourage non-use by non-target population. This categorization is only meant to provide a systematic way to look at the data, in reality, many people fall at the intersection of these categories. The intention behind this form of classification is to help interventions identify what leads to non-use by the target population and improve their design to move towards their definition of use. In this case, we define 'use' to be the utilization of free government facilities by those who cannot afford quality health care over those who have access to affordable care.

\subsection{Factors/design discouraging non-use by non-target population}
Conversations with patients and doctors at the two Mohalla clinics revealed that the economic situation of the population visiting each clinic was different. While clinic A was visited mostly by people belonging to lower socioeconomic groups who lived in slums and worked as rickshaw drivers, housemaids, scavengers and manual laborers, the other, clinic B, was primarily frequented by those belonging to the middle class - people who worked as shopkeepers, business owners, and clerks. When the doctor at clinic B was informed that we were studying use of health care in low-resource environments, he suggested that we visit the other clinic, 

\textit{"More poor people visit the other Mohalla clinic. Here, most people you see are well-to-do."} 

Both clinics were located in the same geographical area, ten minutes from each other. Clinic A was located close to the slums along the Yamuna river while clinic B was near flats in a well-to-do neighborhood. %replace with another word

Most people learned of the clinic from neighbors or because they \textit{"lived right here"}. The setting up of the clinics in that area was not announced formally, according to the doctor at clinic B, the government did not want more people coming to clinic than could handled. However, this meant that awareness of the clinics was limited to people living in its vicinity, and when that area was populated by middle-income groups, they were the ones who came to the clinic.

Before the setting up of clinic B, most people visiting the clinic would have would have visited a private facility close to their home instead, while some would have visited the government dispensary (which was 5 minutes away). The Mohalla clinics now provided them with an alternative option that was free, provided quality care and did not involve a long wait. All the people who came to clinic B said that they were satisfied with the quality care, one woman said,

\textit{"The doctor treated me like I would have been treated at a private clinic."}

More women came to the clinic than men, which could be because the clinics operated during the day when those working could not visit. An interesting phenomenon this lead to at clinic B was that the clinic functioned as a community center in once sense, a meeting point for women. Women would often meet women they knew and would be introduced to other women through them. They would come with their children and talk about their ailments and suggested home-made remedies they could try instead of allopathic medicines. Since the clinic was free, the women would go to the clinic for issues that they would not have visited a doctor for otherwise, ailments that did not chronically affect daily function such as mild back pain, rashes, and headaches. Many of those visiting the clinic were frequent visitors and could be seen at the clinic over multiple days while we were at the clinic. 

The proximity of the clinic, awareness of its presence, positive perception of health care and the safe and comfortable environment provided lead to people outside the target group visiting the clinic. However, this does not explain why the target group did not visit the clinics, which is discussed in the next section. An interesting phenomenon to note here is that awareness that the clinic was meant for the poor did not deter others from visiting the clinic. One woman's response when asked her opinion of the Mohalla clinic is mentioned below and was typical of other responses received, 

\textit{"I think the Mohalla clinic is a good initiative, it beings relief to the poor who cannot afford such facilities otherwise."}

During the course of the study, this phenomenon was not just observed at clinic B, one private hospital visited had separate hours for poor patients when the fees for consultation were lower. However, few poor patients could be seen during this time, most people visiting belonged to the middle-class since no documents were asked to demonstrate economic status.
%Location - Awareness (someone told them, neighbor, dr) - generally go to pvt - expensive - Free medicines - positive perception - Actors (implicitly? - preference to work in “better area” - comment) - Previous experience going to govt dispensary - Effective medicines - Patients come with multiple problems + kids - cannot do that with private - Perception of MC - Women talk while waiting - Waiting time
%\textbf{Quotes/Other data:}
%Patient's complain that medicines provided by private doctors aren't effective. 
%Knowing someone at the health facilities increases the confidence of the patients on the quality of care they are getting
%Some patients figure out a way to utilize the waiting time (esp if token system is in place)
%Poor patient OPD at the private hospital being utilized by middle class patients. 
%Free treatment and medicines means that patients come to the clinic for the smallest of health issues. Should this be deterred? How? Also, patients visit private clinics first and the come to MC to avail of free medicines/tests. Also, patients can dismiss the quality of the treatment because its free. 
\subsection{Factors/design discouraging use by target population} %perhaps discourage isn't the best word in this case - disabling may work better
Looking at the lack of use by the target group at the surface level, lack of awareness about the Mohalla clinic was one of the primary reasons that the target group did not access them. At clinic B, those belonging to lower economic groups who did visit had found out about this clinic because they happened to see someone come out of the gate with medicines or saw a large crowd going in. One woman had been getting medicines for her children regularly and that was putting a strain on her already meager income. 

\textit{"I have been getting medicines for 100 rupees daily for my son who cut his arm. We are poor and cannot afford the expense ... I live only a minute from here but I did not know about this place. I was just walking past this place today and saw people coming in. I asked someone what was going on and they told me that a clinic had opened up here. If I hadn't, I would have never known. If the doctor treats me well then I will come with my children."}

There were also those living near clinic A who did not know about its presence. In one of the slums, a woman who worked as a housemaid asked about the clinic was surprised that there was one right next to her home,

\textit{"There is no government clinic near my place. Are you sure? ... I did not hear of this in my community, no one told me about it. I have been ill recently and my children have rashes so I will visit the doctor. What time did you say it is open? Maybe, I can go on Saturday. And it has been open for a few months now?”}

When we look past the factor of awareness, deeper questions regarding the use of health care in general by those belonging to lower socioeconomic groups arise. Is there a fundamental difference in how the poor make decisions regarding seeking care? If so, this affects the success of the intervention and needs to be addressed. 

While we did not observe any distinct difference in use of clinical facilities based on socioeconomic status, what we did observe was that the needs of those belonging to socioeconomic groups were different which impacted their experience as well as that of the staff. This arose from their poor living environment, low level of education, and societal norms.

\textbf{Quotes/Other data:}

Negative patient experiences and their effect on use of the health facilities. Eg: Complaint about potential vaccination side-effect. How do the dispensaries and MCs respond to patient's complaints? Would that affect the community's perception of the services they are getting (for eg: not up-to standards because the services are government run and free)

One of the ASHA workers reported community members tend to ignore her suggestions and has to force them. Why? Could it be due to lower levels of health care awareness? Maybe they don't see health playing an important role in terms of quality of life and their earning potential, how could this affect their health care seeking behavior? 

Housemaid seems to have good opinion of and detailed knowledge about the services available at government facilities. But also points out waiting time as a major barrier to accessing those services.

Patient's complain that medicines provided by private doctors aren't effective. 

Challenges unique to displaced populations (migrants living in slums)- no documents, long travel distance, high cost- deter them from accessing care.

ASHA worker's limited presence in slums 

Look for convo with maid: she talks about when she can go and her surprise at being unaware of the location of the clinic: Lack of advertising and publicly available information about locations/timings etc.  making the clinics hard to access.

\textbf{Quotes/Other data:}

Role of religion? Religion of health workers and patients being the same might make the interactions easier.

Patient-doctor interactions: Atmosphere of comfort created by doctor being friendly, listening to life stories, berating like a concerned adult when necessary. What enables this? And can conditions be created to enable this? Is this even a good thing? MCs serving as places where a sane, authoritative person can hear out your problems (in some sense, as proxy community centers)

Mohalla clinics as places for enabling other health activities/initiatives e.g immunization drives.

Immunizations advertised through announcements in local mosques. Probably unrelated, but seems like an interesting medium for advertisement. Similar things could be done for MC but that could also be seen as advancing political agendas using religious institutions.
