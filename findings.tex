\section{Findings}
\begin{comment}
This will form the chunk of your writing. I have sometimes iterated through these in written form, or else made a rough outline  on paper and then put it down. It is best that we talk about this section before you attempt to write. Depending on the structure of this section, you might label the section Findings or Analysis. The thing to remember is that all of your data goes into this section, and you need to weave a story around your data that is compelling, novel, and forms the central theme of the paper. If you have done qualitative work, make sure you include these quotes in the findings. Most importantly, do not tell a story based on quotes you have. Pick quotes based on the story you want to tell.
