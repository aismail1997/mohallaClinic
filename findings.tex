\section{Findings}
\begin{comment}
This will form the chunk of your writing. I have sometimes iterated through these in written form, or else made a rough outline  on paper and then put it down. It is best that we talk about this section before you attempt to write. Depending on the structure of this section, you might label the section Findings or Analysis. The thing to remember is that all of your data goes into this section, and you need to weave a story around your data that is compelling, novel, and forms the central theme of the paper. If you have done qualitative work, make sure you include these quotes in the findings. Most importantly, do not tell a story based on quotes you have. Pick quotes based on the story you want to tell.

STORY OF USE

\textcolor{red}{We present our findings from our field work.... [Rough categories - Story of USE?]}

\subsection{Challenges and Affordances (of accessing)}
sustainability - relying on goodwill - low pay + renting premises

\subsection{Design of the intervention}
Design - of the tablet/location/hours, could tie back to the challenges
timing: (open 9 - 1) but extend hours of clinic
guarantee seeing all patients
tablet: limited use - only recording the patient's details - what about using the data to improve the system, feedback system (that would go in discussion) (see pics of app)
location: 2 clinics - same geographical location - 10 minute walk from each other - one near the yamuna river where many of the slums are located. other flats

\subsection{Actors}
Actors - 3 layers - front-line health workers (ASHAs), doctors, patients (also seems to have an element of care)
govt perspective from news articles press releases. Missing piece of our
